# Tea

A toy compiled programming language, made mostly to follow along with the excellent (Crafting Interpreters Book)[https://craftinginterpreters.com].

Tea is made only for x86-64 Linux. Everything is done with this assumption in mind, so it will probably not work otherwise.

## Quick Start

``` shell
git clone https://www.github.com/FeistyKit/tea
cd tea
./tea
```

## Requirements
Requires python3 and (yasm)[http://yasm.tortall.net/]. Again, this only works on x86-64 linux, although it doesn't require libc/GCC.
